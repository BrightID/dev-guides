# EVM integration
BrightID supports clients uploading signed verifications to a smart contract that can then create a registry of verified users.

Each app manages its own registry. An "app" in BrightID can also represent a network or a platform.

Please see the [github repo](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-SmartContract) for templates that can be deployed per app as needed.
