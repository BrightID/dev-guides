# Basic integration

## What's covered
This guide shows you how to let users link their BrightIDs to your app so you can check their verification status.

Other options for integrating BrightID not covered include
* Verifying community members through the [Discord unique bot](https://github.com/ShenaniganDApp/brightid-discord-bot).
* Tightly integrating BrightID connection-making into your app using [API functions](../../node-api) so users don't have to download the BrightID app separately.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have a registered app and context; if not, please [contact a BrightID node operator](https://dev.brightid.org/#step-1).
